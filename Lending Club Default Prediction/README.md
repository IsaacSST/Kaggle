# LendingClub default prediction with Keras
This is a jupyter notebook that cleans the dataset found here:https://www.kaggle.com/wordsforthewise/lending-club, which contains data on loans issued by the website LendingClub.com, including whether they were paid back fully or charged off.
Then it trains a simple ANN with the purpose of classifying whether or not a loan will be paid off or not based on the other data available relating to the borrowers.


## Running the notebook:
For the notebook to work one must extract the dataset from the DATA.rar file, and store it in a folder called DATA, where DATA is in the same directory as the notebook file.
